# Various-Windows-10-Settings
Various things that can be done to make Windows 10 or programs on Windows 10 more convenient/usable (at least to me).

But mostly this is merely a collection of things I have done on my W10 to... as some would say, make it my own. Since these are mostly do-it-once, this repo serves as a reminder for when I need to set up new W10s for myself, or as tips that I can impart to others.

**Note**: This repo will grow slowly if at all, since the default experience is usually decent enough.
